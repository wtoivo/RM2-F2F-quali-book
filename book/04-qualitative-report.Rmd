# Qualitative report


## Using this report writing guide

This section is intended to help you in the write up of your qualitative project report.  When writing your report, remember to use the other resources available to you:

- The feedback your group received on your group proposal
- The feedback you received from RM1
- Braun & Clarke (2013) have an excellent chapter on writing up qualitative research (WHICH CHAPTER? ADD LINK)
- Braun & Clark (2006) paper (ADD LINK)
- Constructing a narrative in TA video (password is Narrative1!) which is available on moodle (ADD LINK)
- Published articles which use a Thematic Analysis (LINK TO READING LIST)
- Helpful resources for APA formatting are [OWL Purdue](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/index.html)
- Materials from [the labs](https://wtoivo.github.io/RM2-F2F-quali-book/labs.html) and [APA Style](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines)
- We have developed a resource of [Frequently Asked Questions](https://wtoivo.github.io/RM2-F2F-quali-book/frequently-asked-questions.html) from previous cohorts
- [Student Learning Development](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/sld/) have useful information about writing for students

If you have further questions, post on Teams and/or visit your tutor's office hours.  All the best in writing your report.

###Suggested word count###

We suggest the following for each section. Adhering to this exactly is not a mandate or requirement (i.e. it is the overall word count is the important one) but it does give an indication of where we do and do not expect to see lots of detail.

Abstract: 100-150 words
Introduction: 700-800 words
Methods: 350-450 words
Analysis: 750-900 words
Discussion: 750-850 words

##Title

The title should reflect the research question(s) and define your sample (e.g., UG students experience of…). Be specific should include: 

- Who
- What 
- How 

*Example* 

**A Thematic Analysis** (how) of the **panic attack experiences** (what) of **primary aged children in inner city Schools in the UK** (who)

**Barriers and enablers to modifying sleep behaviour** (what) in **adolescents and young adults** (who): **A qualitative investigation** (how)


##Abstract (suggested word count: 100-150 words)

In an academic journal, the function of an abstract is to allow the reader to decide whether or not to read the full article.  Aim to summarise all sections of the report in 150 words, including;  1) area of research 2) aim of the study 3) brief methodology, 4) approach to analysis , 5) main findings, and 6) main 'take-away'/ headline findings and implications. Outline your main themes as findings instead of statistics  - as would be typical in a quantitative report. Keep in mind that you are summarising your research for a non-expert and you want to “entice” them to read more.

##Introduction (suggested word count: 700-800 words)

**NOTE TO WIL - DO WE NEED TO INCLUDE THE IMAGE THAT IS IN THE SWAY? IF SO, HOW? ALSO PERHAPS WE REVISE THIS SECTION A LITTLE TO REDUCE THE FOCUS ON FINDING A GAP**

The aim of the introduction is to provide the reader with the necessary background to interpret your rationale for further research  -  this is true whether you are using qualitative or quantitative led enquiry.   You are expected to provide a detailed, critical literature review of relevant, published research  (quantitative and/or qualitative) for this topic/area. Identify the key issues and debates, and use these to develop an argument for your study. As with any introduction to an APA research report, you should develop the introduction using the' funnel approach'. You start with a broad overview of the topic and get more and more specific, until you arrive at the rationale for 'your' research and of course the research question(s).

Remember you have a limited number of words to say all of this, so your literature review should focus on relevant and recent articles in the area that have influenced your choice of research question.  Do try to locate the most recent examples of qualitative research in this well defined topic area - take the reader to the last example of relevant research and say how you plan to 'build' on this research - helping to create a great rationale! The topic guide **(ADD IN LINK)** cites a number of relevant studies.  Identify the most relevant studies, and you are also expected to find your own research articles related to your research question. Remember to reference all sources of information in the text (for example, government reports, websites, media reports).  

A resource for helping you to develop evaluation in your introductions can be found in the Week X lab materials **(ADD LINK)**

Next, remember to outline any limitations of previous studies - critique (however, make sure the limitations you discuss are actually something your study can address - otherwise your rationale will not be very strong)! Instead of just describing previous studies, try to evaluate them. What do the findings mean? Are there any contrasting findings? If so, why?  This should lead clearly to a justification of your own study; how will your study address these issues?  This should not be done independently of your literature review. When you are outlining the research and theory you should be developing a clear rationale for your research question. 

**Finally, explain your study and clearly outline your research question/s.**

In sum:
- Review and evaluate previous theories and research relevant to the topic.
- Provide a clear justification and explanation of your study, linked to your research questions
- The main and subsidiary research questions have been outlined clearly and offer good alignment with qualitative methods (in this case a thematic approach).

Remember that the point of this section is exactly the same as a quantitative report: you are demonstrating what work has been done in the past, to build up an argument as to why the current study has been conducted.
