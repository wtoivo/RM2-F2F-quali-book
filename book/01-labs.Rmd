# Labs

In this chapter you will find the lab materials/activities. Slides will be linked from this chapter, but can be found on moodle. 

Each lab focuses on supporting you with your qualitative project. As part of this project, you will complete two summative assessments (one as a group (30%) and one as an individual (50%)).

The Labs will be on the following topics:
- Week 1: What is qualitative research?
- Week 2: Group work, Developing Research Questions
- Week 3: Ethics
- Week 4: Developing a focus group schedule
- Week 5: Running a focus group
- Week 7: Data processing and reflection
- Week 8: Evaluation in the Introduction and Discussion
- Week 9: Analysis (coding)
- Week 10: Analysis (themes)

**NOTE: All slides will need links updated to new ones**

In Lab 1, we will introduce you to qualitative research, and consider the differences between qualitative and quantitative. You will work together in groups to complete two activities. 

### Lab 1 Activity 1: Differences between qualitative and quantitative studies

Look at the table below, then discuss the questions underneath in your groups.

**TO DO: TABLE NEEDS ADDED IN**

Q1. What might a 'typical' *quantitative* study look like? What kind of data might be collected? What would be the aim of the study? What might your sample look like?

Q2. What might a 'typical' *qualitative* study look like? What kind of data might be collected? What would be the aim of the study? What might your sample look like?

Q3. What type of research question might be best answered with a *quantitative* design?

Q4. What type of research question might be best answered with a *qualitative* design?


### Lab 1 Activity 2: Qualitative or quantitative?

Choose whether a quantitative or qualitative design is most appropriate for each of the following studies. Why did you
choose each option?

Q1. Angela is conducting a study exploring the experience of people currently experience mental ill health. She is interested in a) better understanding what people with mental ill health experience day-to-day, and b) exploring the support mechanisms that are in place.

Q2. Ali is conducting a study where he is measuring whether the amount of sleep that children get is related to their cognitive performance in class. He asks the children to wear a sleep tracker to bed, so he can see when they are sleeping and when they are awake.

Q3. Sally is conducting a study where she is interested in the effects of violence on TV on children.

Q4. Charlie is conducting a study where they want to better understand motivations for smoking among teenagers.

Q5. Elaine is conducting a study exploring whether the amount of studying done in preparation for an exam predicts exam performance.


## Week 2 Lab 2: Groupwork and RQs

Key resources: 

Lab 2 slides - **ADD LINK**

[Topic Guide](https://wtoivo.github.io/RM2-F2F-quali-book/group-project-preparation.html#topic-guide)

**Wil and Ashley to discuss** - Is there a way for us to link to the spreadsheet directly (here and below) but make it inaccessible until we are ready to release it? (e.g. can we link to the moodle activity rather than the spreadsheet, so that they can only access it if it has been made available?)

---

In Lab 2, you will form into the groups that you will  be in for the rest of the semester. You will be able to find your group in the spreadsheet at the bottom of the Week 2 Moodle (https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=38155&section=3) (please note the spreadsheet will only become available after Week 2 starts). In these groups, you will a) design, run and transcribe a focus group with a group in your lab as your participants, b) participate in another group's focus group, and c) write a qualitative group proposal. 

In today's lab, there will be some time spent getting to know each other, then we will ask you to develop a group agreement (see below). You should also discuss the different topics (*add in link for this*) that you can choose for your project, seeing whether any stand out as preferred options among the group.

### Lab 2 Activity 1: Group Agreements and Task Allocation

We appreciate that group work can be challenging and we want to support you to have an enjoyable and educational group work experience. To that end, we would like each group to create a group agreement that all members sign. The purpose of this is for the group to come together and establish common ground and rules that each of the group members is committed to. 

After you have all introduced yourselves, download the [group agreement template](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EX0j7-IboldEnapucgQ7h-YBERu8yPzvpIZa7R_AQu8jhw?e=hHbS8A). Then look at the list of potential items to include. These are provided within the template document itself, as well as in **Chapter X.X.X.** As a group, discuss which items you want to include in addition to the standard ones provided, and if there are any you would like to edit or add outside of this list. After this, you should allocate tasks for the **group proposal** among the members of the group. A starter list of tasks is provided in the template as well as in **Chapter X.X.X**. (see list of tasks below). The task allocation must be uploaded in the same document as the signed group agreement.**DISCUSS WITH WIL - MEANS ONE UPLOAD PER PERSON RATHER THAN ONE PER PERSON PLUS A GROUP ONE)**

Work on a collaborative document on OneDrive to create your group work agreement and allocation of tasks for the group proposal. Once the group is happy with their agreement, *each group member* should sign it and submit it to Moodle individually (Formative Assessment Section). Each person should submit their signed group agreement and task allocation before their lab in Week 3. 

Once the deadline has passed, we will be in touch with any groups where any members have not uploaded a group agreement and task allocation for the group proposal. 

### Lab 2 Activity 2: Research Questions

**NOTE TO WIL: Think that Maxine struggled to get any to do Campus Climate so might be worth only having the three topics?**

In your groups, have a look at the [Topic Guide](https://wtoivo.github.io/RM2-F2F-quali-book/group-project-preparation.html#topic-guide). There are X topics to choose from: Green Spaces, **(CAMPUS CLIMATE)** Belonging and Mental Health. 

Have a look over the topics - are there any that your group are particularly drawn towards at this stage? You might know immediately what you'd like to focus on, or might need to discuss all of them in your group. 

Once you've chosen a topic (you might not manage this in the lab, which is fine!), have a think about possible research questions. You will need to have a finalised RQ for your group proposal, which is submitted in Week 5. 

## Week 3 Lab 3: Ethics

---

Key resources: 

Lab 3 slides **(ADD LINK)**

**TO DISCUSS: Do we include any of this information (e.g. activity 3) as a word doc or is it okay in here as is?**

---

In Lab 3, we will cover ethics and you will complete two activities within your groups. 

### Information required for the lab activities

**Research Question (this is also relevant for our FG questions)**

*This might look like:* In qualitative research, we often ask about someone’s lived
experience, or their motivations, or a belief they have. This is quite different to
quantitative research.

*Why might this be an issue:* Qualitative research tends to be on topics where we ask
people to be vulnerable and open themselves up to us as researchers. If we don't frame
this correctly, our interview schedule might contain questions that are inappropriate.


**Data Collection**

*This might look like:* Data collection is much less likely to be anonymous, as typically in-
person or online focus groups or interviews are held. Samples are small, and
participants may already be known to the researcher.

*Why might this be an issue:* There are possible issues of confidentiality, anonymity
(these will be discussed further down) and bias. Our preconceptions might affect the
way we frame the questions, how we interact with participants in the focus group, and
how we interpret the data.


**Recording a focus group or interview**

*This might look like:* The majority of the time, focus groups and interviews are recorded
(either audio + video or audio only). This means that the 'raw' data - as it were - is
identifiable. In contrast, data for quant studies are often collected anonymously.

*Why might this be an issue:* Data should always be kept safe and secure. However, with
qualitative data, there is a real risk that individual people could be identified from a
recording of them. This  means that dealing with the recordings in a safe and secure
way are of utmost importance, and that participants cannot be identified from
transcripts.


**Anonymity**

*This might look like:* In quantitative research, we tend to report summary statistics from
groups, and therefore it’d be quite unusual to be able to identify a single participant
from the data. With qualitative, it’s a bit different. We collect people’s words and
experiences.

*Why might this be an issue:* It is easier to identify someone from the words they use,
and the situations and circumstances they describe.


**Confidentiality**

*This might look like:* In a focus group or interview, people might be very open with us,
and tell us things about their life, and the lives of others.

*Why might this be an issue:* We have a duty of care to keep anything that comes out in a
focus group/interview confidential (unless they disclose a crime or someone is judged
to be at risk). It’s also vital that the rest of the focus group members keep the
information confidential too.



### Lab 3 Activity 1: Mitatigation of the issues

Consider the issues in the section above. In your groups, discuss each one in turn, thinking about the various steps that could be taken to reduce or remove these issues.

The issues that should be discussed are:

- Research Question
- Data Collection
- Recording a focus group or interview
- Anonymity
- Confidentiility


### Lab 3 Activity 2: Fictional focus group example

Angela and John have run a focus group study to explore the experiences of UK university staff members during the pandemic. Below you will find their focus group schedule (the questions that they asked in the focus group), some correspondence they had about the study, and an excerpt of their data for the final write-up they are about to submit to a journal. 

In your groups, try to identify what ethical issues there are, and how they could have been mitigated.

**Focus group schedule**

1. What has been your experience with teaching during the pandemic?
2. How has this affected your personal life? What impact has your increased workload had on that? 
3. Can you describe some of the negative effects that this has had on your mental health? 
    Prompt: What has been the worst thing about the pandemic for you?
4. How has your employer supported you during the pandemic? 
5. How has your student contact differed from previous years? 

**Correspondence between the authors**

*Email 1:* 

“Hi Angela,

Please see attached a Google Drive link to the raw data with focus group number 3. I’m just working on the anonymisation of FG4 on the library computers and will send it to you asap.

Cheers,

J”

*Email 2:*

“Hi,

Thanks for the update! Actually my dissertation student is very interested in the topic so I thought they would help with the data analysis – can you share the raw data folder with 12345@student.gla.ac.uk also?

-Angela”


**Data Excerpt**

Participant 1: “For me, as I’m the course lead for first-year philosophy, the workload was
just simply too much to handle at times and I felt so alone.”

Participant 2: “Yeah, I agree, umm, it was really hard to just keep going with extra hours
and that feeling of isolation”

Moderator: “What about you, Participant 3, how was your mental health affected
negatively?”


## Week 4 Lab 4: Developing Focus Group questions

---

Key resources:

Lab 4 slides **(ADD LINK)**

---

In Lab 4, we will work on developing questions for your focus group. We have made a bank of questions available to you. Please select any questions that you would like to use from this bank (**FOUND HERE- ADD IN**) and then adapt them to suit your research question. 

If you have developed a research question that is slightly different from those suggested, then you may need to make up some new questions to go into your focus group schedule. 

If you develop new questions that have not been adapted from the bank of questions provided, please ensure you do the following:
1. Questions must be developed using the guidance provided to you in this lab
2. You **must** attend your tutor's office hours and ask for feedback on your questions. 

If, however, you only use questions from the bank that is supplied or make minor tweaks, you are not *required* to formally discuss these with your tutor (although you are welcome to do so if you have specific questions that you want to ask). You might, for example, want to check the order that you present the questions in. 

### Lab 4 Activity 1: Research Questions

Please have your Research Question ready for your tutor, and discuss it with them as they come round the groups. Do you have any other questions about the group proposal that you want to ask? Please work on the other two activities until your tutor makes it to your group.

### Lab 4 Activity 2: Appropriateness of questions

Look at the following focus group questions. For each, decide whether a) they are appropriate and b) whether they should be adapted or not? If you think they should be, how would you change them? 

**Research Question: How does students' sense of belonging relate to participation in team sport?**

1. How many hours of group sport do you participate in each week?
2. What does being a part of a team mean to you?
3. What does belonging mean to you? 
4. How has your sense of belonging improved since joining your sports group?
5. I'm going to go round the group one at a time. I need each person to tell me about a time where they've felt that they haven't belonged to their team, and how that impacted on them personally? 
6. Please tell me, on a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being not at all and 5 being hugely) how much you feel like you belong to your sports team?
7. Do you like being a part of a sports team?

### Lab 4 Activity 3: Rewording questions

Have a look at these poorly written fictional focus group questions. The research question is there to help you (you do not need to re-word this). 

Research question: Exploring international students' experiences of their sense of belonging and homesickness

Q1. Have you ever felt homesick while studying abroad?
Q2. How has this negatively affected you?
Q3. How often do you feel like you don't belong?

- Try to re-write these questions to improve them, thinking about the clarity and the quality of data they would give you
- Write your own question to add to the revised questions above, thinking about the guidance you’ve been given about developing good questions

---

In this week's lab, we will cover some key things that you will need to know in order to run a focus group. We also have some activities for you to do in groups. 

### Lab 5 Activity 1: Allocation of tasks


Look at the list of focus group tasks **(ADD LINK)** in the Group project: Preparation chapter of this book.

Allocate tasks between your group members (write this down and make sure everybody has a copy of it). If you are missing group members, make sure to catch up with them and discuss task allocation

### Lab 5 Activity 2: How would you manage these situations?

In your groups, discuss the following scenarios. What might you do if these happen when you run your focus groups? What might you try to help the situation?  

1. Nobody answers the questions you have asked
2. The conversation goes completely off-topic
3. One participant dominates the conversation
4. One participant is seemingly uncomfortable and doesn't say anything
5. Participants don't seem comfortable/confident answering questions in English

Note down some suggestions among the group about how you might manage these situations and we will discuss as a class. 


## Week 7 Lab 6: Data processing and reflection

Lab 6 slides (**ADD LINK**)

### Lab 6 Activity 1: Anonymise the transcript

Take a look at the short excerpt below. In your group, try to anonymise it, thinking about whether you would choose to redact or replace the information. 

Transcript:

*Jane:...I grew up in Brighton and you see men holding hands all the time in Brighton, and Tim came out when I was about 12 or 13 (pause) I think he was 16 or maybe 15, he was definitely still at Michael Hall because I used to get teased about being gay myself...*

*Interviewer: And, when did you come out?*

*Jane: I came out in the first year of university so I must have been 19 or 20, I had a gap year before going to Durham...my mum freaked a bit, she was totally okay, but I think even for her – someone who lives in Brighton and writes for the Guardian – two gay kids was a bit much... my Aunty Julie, my mum’s sister, was absolutely wonderful though, and she’s a lesbian...*

Did you agree on all the points? If not, why not? Remember that there is no one 'correct' answer; it's not unusual to have different opinions about how you should approach it!

### Lab 6 Activity 2: Reflection on RM1 

Feedback is most useful when it is reflected on and incorporated into subsequent assessments. For this reason, we ask you to complete an activity where you reflect on the feedback you received in RM1, thinking about what you want to focus on for your RM2 report. 

- Complete [this document](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/ES-Vc-s5kxZGo8wqcvvfmawBjrTG_q6WpNtTT18StzwS8w?e=aY8Pmx), reflecting on the RM1 feedback you received, and considering what you might focus on improving for your RM2 report.
- You will need your RM1 registered report feedback (both Stage 1 and Stage 2) and the Qualitative report AIS to complete this activity
