<p>Topic Guide(<strong>ADD IN LINK HERE TO TOPIC GUIDE FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE BOOK</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Wil and Ashley to discuss</strong> - Is there a way for us to link to the spreadsheet directly (here and below) but make it inaccessible until we are ready to release it?</p>
<hr>
<p>In Lab 2, you will form into the groups that you will be in for the rest of the semester. You will be able to find your group in the spreadsheet at the bottom of the Week 2 Moodle (<a href="https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=38155&amp;section=3" class="uri">https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=38155&amp;section=3</a>) (please note the spreadsheet will only become available after Week 2 starts).In these groups, you will a) design, run and transcribe a focus group with a group in your lab as your participants, b) participate in another group's focus group, and c) write a qualitative group proposal.</p>
<p>In today's lab, there will be some time spent getting to know each other, then we will ask you to develop a group agreement (see below). You should also discuss the different topics (<em>add in link for this</em>) that you can choose for your project, seeing whether any stand out as preferred options among the group.</p>
<div id="lab-2-activity-1-group-agreements" class="section level3">

</h3>
<p>We appreciate that group work can be challenging and we want to support you to have an enjoyable and educational group work experience. To that end, we would like each group to create a group agreement that all members sign. The purpose of this is for the group to come together and establish common ground and rules that each of the group members is committed to.</p>
<p>Download the <a href="https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EX0j7-IboldEnapucgQ7h-YBERu8yPzvpIZa7R_AQu8jhw?e=hHbS8A">group agreement template</a>. Then look at the list of potential items to include below, and as a group, discuss which items you want to include in addition to the standard ones provided, and if there are any you would like to edit or add outside of this list.</p>
<p>Work on a collaborative document on OneDrive to create your group work agreement. Once the group is happy with their agreement, <em>each group member</em> should sign it and submit it to Moodle individually (Formative Assessment Section). Each person should submit their signed group agreement before their lab in Week 3.</p>
<p>Once the deadline has passed, we will be in touch with any groups where any members have not uploaded a group agreement.</p>

<p>Here is a list of items you may want to discuss with your group and add to the group agreement:</p>
<p>We all agree to establish a common timeline for the project and discuss any deviations from the timeline together as a group
- We all agree to communicate with each other openly and honestly about the project and get in touch with the course leads in the event of an unsolvable group conflict.
- We all agree to respect each other's individual ways of working and will discuss these openly as a group.
- We all agree to respect diversity in our group. This includes cultural differences, neurodiversity, different work/life situations and may manifest in different ways of working/approaching tasks. We agree to discuss our strengths as a group and divide tasks accordingly.
- I agree to stay in touch with the group and communicate as established by the group. If I am struggling and I do not feel comfortable sharing that with the group, I will get in touch with the course/programme leads for support
- We all agree to meet on a regular basis as established by the group. If I cannot make a meeting, I agree to communicate this openly with my group and get in touch to catch up about things I have missed.
- We agree to plan out the individual contribution of each team member in advance before group work starting and openly communicate any changes that may arise during the project.
- We agree to establish the best method of communication for our group that's inclusive and takes into account everybody's individual needs.</p>

</h2>
<p><em>TO DISCUSS: We had the pre-lab activity of the contribution document, so will be changing this for the agreement. The students, at the moment, have to submit their group agreement before Lab 3. We have an activity in Lab 5 to allocate tasks for the proposal Do we get them to append it in this lab and change it to Lab 4 (this will then impact on when we are able to contact the groups before the deadline)? Or do we have it as a separate activity and they do it for their own records (and we can ask for it if we need)? Or do we adapt the group agreement in Lab 2 so they do the tasks at that point, and it's uploaded as a whole document?</em></p>
<p><strong>ANOTHER THING TO DISCUSS: One thing we could do, is we could develop a template 'contribution document' which has two sections - one for tasks for the group proposal (Lab 2 (submitted by Lab 3) and then tasks for the wider project (Lab 5). Perhaps one agreed contribution document is submitted per group by end of Week 6 (reading week) whereas the group agreement is submitted individually?</strong></p>

</h3>
<p><strong>Research Question (this is also relevant for our FG questions)</strong></p>
<p><em>This might look like:</em> In qualitative research, we often ask about someone’s lived
experience, or their motivations, or a belief they have. This is quite different to
quantitative research.</p>
<p><em>Why might this be an issue:</em> Qualitative research tends to be on topics where we ask
people to be vulnerable and open themselves up to us as researchers. If we don't frame
this correctly, our interview schedule might contain questions that are inappropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Data Collection</strong></p>
<p><em>This might look like:</em> Data collection is much less likely to be anonymous, as typically in-
person or online focus groups or interviews are held. Samples are small, and
participants may already be known to the researcher.</p>
<p><em>Why might this be an issue:</em> There are possible issues of confidentiality, anonymity
(these will be discussed further down) and bias. Our preconceptions might affect the
way we frame the questions, how we interact with participants in the focus group, and
how we interpret the data.</p>
<p><strong>Recording a focus group or interview</strong></p>
<p><em>This might look like:</em> The majority of the time, focus groups and interviews are recorded
(either audio + video or audio only). This means that the 'raw' data - as it were - is
identifiable. In contrast, data for quant studies are often collected anonymously.</p>
<p><em>Why might this be an issue:</em> Data should always be kept safe and secure. However, with
qualitative data, there is a real risk that individual people could be identified from a
recording of them. This means that dealing with the recordings in a safe and secure
way are of utmost importance, and that participants cannot be identified from
transcripts.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymity</strong></p>
<p><em>This might look like:</em> In quantitative research, we tend to report summary statistics from
groups, and therefore it’d be quite unusual to be able to identify a single participant
from the data. With qualitative, it’s a bit different. We collect people’s words and
experiences.</p>
<p><em>Why might this be an issue:</em> It is easier to identify someone from the words they use,
and the situations and circumstances they describe.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>
<p><em>This might look like:</em> In a focus group or interview, people might be very open with us,
and tell us things about their life, and the lives of others.</p>
<p><em>Why might this be an issue:</em> We have a duty of care to keep anything that comes out in a
focus group/interview confidential (unless they disclose a crime or someone is judged
to be at risk). It’s also vital that the rest of the focus group members keep the
information confidential too.</p>

<p>Angela and John have run a focus group study to explore the experiences of UK university staff members during the pandemic. Below you will find their focus group schedule (the questions that they asked in the focus group), some correspondence they had about the study, and an excerpt of their data for the final write-up they are about to submit to a journal.</p>
<p>In your groups, try to identify what ethical issues there are, and how they could have been mitigated.</p>
<p><strong>Focus group schedule</strong></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What has been your experience with teaching during the pandemic?</li>
<li>How has this affected your personal life? What impact has your increased workload had on that?</li>
<li>Can you describe some of the negative effects that this has had on your mental health?
Prompt: What has been the worst thing about the pandemic for you?</li>
<li>How has your employer supported you during the pandemic?</li>
<li>How has your student contact differed from previous years?</li>

<p>“Hi Angela,</p>
<p>Please see attached a Google Drive link to the raw data with focus group number 3. I’m just working on the anonymisation of FG4 on the library computers and will send it to you asap.</p>

<p>J”</p>
<p><em>Email 2:</em></p>
<p>“Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the update! Actually my dissertation student is very interested in the topic so I thought they would help with the data analysis – can you share the raw data folder with <a href="mailto:12345@student.gla.ac.uk" class="email">12345@student.gla.ac.uk</a> also?</p>
<p>-Angela”</p>
<p><strong>Data Excerpt</strong></p>
<p>Participant 1: “For me, as I’m the course lead for first-year philosophy, the workload was
just simply too much to handle at times and I felt so alone.”</p>
<p>Participant 2: “Yeah, I agree, umm, it was really hard to just keep going with extra hours
and that feeling of isolation”</p>
<p>Moderator: “What about you, Participant 3, how was your mental health affected
negatively?”</p>

<p>In Lab 4, we will work on developing questions for your focus group. We have made a bank of questions available to you. Please select any questions that you would like to use from this bank (<strong>FOUND HERE- ADD IN</strong>) and then adapt them to suit your research question.</p>
<p>If you have developed a research question that is slightly different from those suggested, then you may need to make up some new questions to go into your focus group schedule.</p>
<p>If you develop new questions that have not been adapted from the bank of questions provided, please ensure you do the following:
1. Questions must be developed using the guidance provided to you in this lab
2. You <strong>must</strong> attend your tutor's office hours and ask for feedback on your questions.</p>
<p>If, however, you only use questions from the bank that is supplied or make minor tweaks, you are not <em>required</em> to formally discuss these with your tutor (although you are welcome to do so if you have specific questions that you want to ask). You might, for example, want to check the order that you present the questions in.</p>
