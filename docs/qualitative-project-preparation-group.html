<p>The qualitative project for RM2 has both group and individual components, and you will gain experience of designing a study, collecting data, being a participant in another group's study, processing data, analysing data and writing your data up. All of these will build on the skills you learned in RM1, and will help prepare you to complete your own independent research project for your dissertation.</p>
<p>The qualitative project is broken down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>In your groups, you will write a group proposal detailing the key literature for your project, as well as why it is important to conduct. This is a group assessment and is worth 30% of RM2.</li>
<li>In your groups, you will choose a topic, then finalise your research question. You will then choose questions you want to ask your participants. You will be allocated another group <strong>within your lab</strong> to act as your participants. In turn, you will be the participants for another group within your lab.</li>
<li>In your groups, you will hold a focus group, which will be held online using Microsoft Teams. You will then prepare your focus group transcript and anonymise it.</li>
<li>From this point on, the remainder of the project is conducted individually, with you completing analysis and writing up your report (worth 50% of RM2) on your own. Please note that you <strong>MUST</strong> use thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2006) for your analysis. You are not allowed to use any other forms of analysis (e.g. IPA).</li>

<p>We appreciate that group work can be challenging and we want to support you to have an enjoyable and educational group work experience. To that end, we would like each group to create a group agreement that all members sign. The purpose of this is for the group to come together and establish common ground and rules that each of the group members is committed to. You will also be asked to allocate tasks, firstly for the group proposal (in Week 2, alongside the Group Agreement) and then for the Focus Group in Week 5.</p>

Then look at the list of potential items to include. These are provided within the template document itself, as well as below. As a group, discuss which items you want to include in addition to the standard ones provided, and if there are any you would like to edit or add outside of this list. Then, allocate tasks for the <strong>group proposal</strong> and upload this document individually to moodle before your Week 3 lab. You will be asked, separately, to allocate tasks for the Focus Group in your <strong>Week 5 lab.</strong></p>

<li>We all agree to respect each other's individual ways of working and will discuss these openly as a group.</li>
<li>We all agree to respect diversity in our group. This includes cultural differences, neurodiversity, different work/life situations and may manifest in different ways of working/approaching tasks. We agree to discuss our strengths as a group and divide tasks accordingly.</li>
<li>I agree to stay in touch with the group and communicate as established by the group. If I am struggling and I do not feel comfortable sharing that with the group, I will get in touch with the course/programme leads for support</li>
<li>We all agree to meet on a regular basis as established by the group. If I cannot make a meeting, I agree to communicate this openly with my group and get in touch to catch up about things I have missed.</li>
<li>We agree to plan out the individual contribution of each team member in advance before group work starting and openly communicate any changes that may arise during the project.</li>

<span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Topic Guide<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#topic-guide"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>As part of your qualitative project, you will be expected to write a review of the literature as part of your Introduction section. It is important that the Introduction has a clear rationale which supports your chosen research question.</p>
<p>What follows here is an outline of various topics you should consider when you develop your research question, and which form the starting point for you project.</p>
<p>One of the aims of qualitative research is to be critical of some of the assumptions made by mainstream quantitative studies and to highlight their limitations. In highlighting limitations, you should aim to develop research questions that address weaknesses identified and provide a rationale for using a focus group methodology.</p>
<p>You should use this topic guide to help you plan your study, and support you with your research questions and rationale assignment. However, you are in no way expected to read everything in the reference section (or even within each topic). These references are provided purely to give you a starting point, and you are encouraged to go beyond the scope of what is provided here.</p>
<p>After the four topics have been presented, we will provide some information about your rationale, and also some key steps for moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Three research topics:</strong></p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Topic 1: Nature access, nature connectedness and wellbeing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#topic-1-nature-access-nature-connectedness-and-wellbeing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Philosophers, writers, environmentalists and ecologists have long argued that humans derive physiological and psychological benefits from spending time in natural environments, such as forests, beaches or mountains (Wilson, 1984). Wilson argued for a strong evolutionary basis for this effect: our species had spent hundreds of thousands of years (nearly all of its evolutionary history) living and thriving within natural environments, humans should have a deep rooted connection with nature that is beneficial to us. Since everyday survival depended on activities such as finding food, water or firewood, and avoiding predators, all of which required humans to be attentive and responsive to any cues the environment might offer, individuals who were more connected with nature would have had an important advantage in that context.</p>
<p>Over half of the world’s population lives in an urban, rather than rural, environment and this is expected to increase to 68% by 2050 (United Nations, 2018; World Health Organization, 2011). In Canada, more than 80% of people live in urban areas, and Canadians spend almost 90% of their time indoors (Howell &amp; Passmore, 2013). In a survey of 1,000 United Kingdom citizens, only 55% of those over the age of 35, and 37% of those under the age of 35, reported feeling “connected to the natural world” (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, 2010). Both time-criterion and nature- knowledge-criterion studies show that nature-based recreation is on the decline in many countries (Charles &amp; Louv, 2009).</p>
<p>At the same time, research into nature connectedness shows that engaging with natural environments can have beneficial effects on a wide range of psychological and physiological aspects of wellbeing (Burns, 2005; White et al., 2019), and that these effects can be seen even with relatively minor interventions (Berto, 2005). In the last 30 years, environmental and positive psychologists have gathered considerable evidence that supports the idea that humans benefit from contact with nature ( Berto, 2014; Howell &amp; Passmore, 2013), and that green space can provide a buffer against the negative health impact of stressful life events (van den Berg et al., 2010). The available research investigates a wide range of benefits, from physical health and longevity to happiness, cognitive focus and attentional capacity, and has been done using a wide variety of methods. Considering the preponderance of stress and mental health problems facing the developed world (Gullone, 2000; WHO, 2022), studying the effects of nature is an important task for psychologists. On a more personally relevant note, understanding the effects of green spaces and animals on wellbeing can give you another set of tools that can be used to enhance your own wellbeing and help cope with the stress of university life.</p>
<p><strong>Nature affiliation and access to nature</strong></p>
<p>There are two important related concepts in nature connectedness literature.</p>
<p><em>Access to nature</em> means the extent to which a person is in contact with nature, which can be measured objectively by logging location or looking at area maps. A lot of epidemiological studies use objective measures of green space access to see if it affects population health, while experimental studies can use nature contact interventions to see how people respond.</p>
<p><em>Nature connectedness/affiliation trait:</em> this means the personal characteristics that make a person appreciate nature more and is usually measured with self-report questionnaires. It has been defined as “individuals’ experiential sense of oneness with the natural world” (Mayer &amp; Frantz, 2004). Smaller studies often look at how the trait of nature connectedness interacts with nature access to predict various aspects of wellbeing.</p>
<p>State of nature connectedness: this means the current, changing relationship with nature, something that is “dynamic, changing from day to day and moment to moment as a function of experiences with nature” (Weinstein, Przybylski, &amp; Ryan, 2009).</p>
<p><strong>Research on effects of nature access and connectedness</strong></p>
<p><em>Large scale epidemiological research</em></p>
<p>One of the possible ways of investigating nature connectedness is by comparing similar populations with varying degrees of access to natural environments. One of such studies analysed five year survival rates for over 3000 Tokyo seniors, born between 1903 and 1918 (Takano, Nakamura, &amp; Watanabe, 2002) and found that longevity was greater among senior citizens living in areas with walkable green spaces. Variables such as age, sex, marital status, socioeconomic status, and baseline physical ability were controlled. Having walkable green streets and spaces near the seniors’ residences showed significant predictive value for elderly survival over the 5 years of the study.</p>
<p>In Holland, researchers reviewed records for 250,782 citizens being treated by 104 general practitioners and confirmed a robust relationship between green spaces and health (Maas, Verheij, Groenewegen, de Vries, &amp; Spreeuwenberg, 2006). The paper reported that “health differences in residents of urban and rural municipalities are to a large extent explained by the amount of green space” in the individuals’ direct living environment (p. 591). Additionally, the relation between green space and health was found to be stronger for lower socioeconomic groups and that elderly, youth, and secondary educated people in large cities seemed to benefit more from presence of green areas in their living environment than other groups.</p>
<p>Finally, University of Glasgow researchers (Mitchell &amp; Popham, 2008) looked at income-related health inequality within the English population below the retirement age, obtaining anonymised data from the Office for National Statistics and amassing data from over 40 million people. They found that populations living in the greenest environments also had lowest levels of health inequality related to income deprivation and had lower all-cause and circulatory mortality rates.</p>
<p>Overall, the available large scale epidemiological research shows a clear association between having access to green spaces in urban areas or living in a natural setting and various subjective and objective health outcomes. These associations remain relevant when controlling for education and income, and in fact become stronger for lower levels of socioeconomic status. This has implications for supporting student mental health in higher education (Hughes &amp; Spanner, 2019), with universities recognising the impact of the campus environment and green space as part of a stepped approach to supporting student mental health and wellbeing (Universities UK, 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Correlational research</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous correlational studies that look at how nature access and nature affiliation affect different aspects of wellbeing. The studies that established the three measures of nature affiliation found significant correlations between their scales and life satisfaction (Mayer &amp; Frantz, 2004), positive affect (Mayer et al., 2009) and autonomy, positive affect and personal growth (Nisbet, Zelenski, &amp; Murphy, 2011). Herzog &amp; Strevey (2008) also showed that undergraduate students’ self-reported degree of contact with nature correlated with positive affect and personal growth.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental research</strong></p>
<p>Experimental research on nature access and connectedness is focused on presenting participants with nature-related interventions and observing whether these had a positive effect on a variety of measures of health and wellbeing. Mayer et al. (2009) carried out three experiments manipulating exposure to nature - spending 15 min in either a nature park or in an urban setting, watching a 10-min video clip of nature or urban setting and engaging in a nature walk or to watch a video clip of the same walk. In all three of these studies, the nature condition had no effect on negative affect, but participants’ positive affect was boosted compared to those in the control conditions. Berman, Jonides, &amp; Kaplan (2008) randomly assigned undergraduate students to spend 50 min walking in either a park or an urban setting, and discovered that only the nature walk resulted in a mood increase. Weinstein et al. (2009) carried out 4 experiments looking at whether exposure to nature affected how we value intrinsic aspirations, which are goals that in themselves satisfy basic psychological needs (such as personal growth, intimacy, community) and extrinsic aspirations, which are pursued to derive rewards or positive regard from others (e.g., money, image, fame). In all four studies, participants exposed to nature endorsed more intrinsic and less extrinsic values, which is in turn related to helpfulness in social situations, and feelings of community cohesion.</p>
<p><strong>Qualitative approach</strong></p>
<p>Despite a richness of quantitative studies on this topic, very few qualitative enquiries have been published to date. Combined with the relative rarity of qualitative approaches to topics not immediately neighbouring social psychology, this means that there is a lot of scope for qualitative research within positive psychology, and the field of nature connectedness in particular.</p>
<p>One interesting mixed methods study has been done on students using a green prescription activity of taking a walk in nature, facilitated by a mobile phone app (Boyd, 2022). The intervention and students’ experience of engaging with the natural environment were discussed in focus groups and analysed using a grounded theory approach. Key themes included students’ experience of and the design of university spaces, a desire for safe and sociable spaces, nature as a place of shelter from the city, and requests for more natural and wild landscapes. Interestingly, cultural and social factors, such as working hours and upbringing influenced students’ seeking out opportunities to interact with green spaces while on campus.</p>
<p>Another mixed methods study on the wellbeing of allotment gardeners (Webber, Hinds, &amp; Camic, 2015) found that the gardeners’ subjective well-being and quality of life were higher than population means would suggest, and that this was related to the time they spent in their allotments and how connected to nature they felt. Analysis of open ended survey responses indicated 4 main themes in the data: having own space, feeling connectedness, benefits to physical health and engaging in meaningful activity. This study set forth with a very broad qualitative research question, and only had a limited form of data to work with, so the themes are very general.</p>
<p>A fully qualitative study was carried out on Toronto and Chicago office workers’ perceptions of green roof spaces (Loder, 2014). Loder carried out phenomenological, social constructionist analysis of semi-structured interviews, which covered constructs such as attitudes to nature and green roofs in particular, health and work environment. The analysis uncovered five themes: aesthetics of roof spaces, surprise and fascination with the greens spaces, symbolism of urban green spaces and the relationship between green roofs and well-being.</p>

</h3>
<p>There has been increasing concern about the mental health of students at university. In a survey of over 2,000 students, suicide ideation was reported by 2%. Anxiety and depression symptoms were also commonly reported (Eisenberg et al., 2007). Another study conducted over two time points found that mental health problems are persistent and that many people do not seek the help they need (Zivin et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Interestingly, it has been shown that sleep disturbances in students, when treated, can also improve mental health status (Freeman et al., 2015), suggesting an intimate link between sleep and mental health. Guidelines have been published by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine as to how much sleep is recommended across different age groups. For teenagers aged 13-18 , 8-10 hours are recommended, for adults (aged 18-60), 7 hours or more on a regular basis is recommended for optimal mental and physical health (Badr et al., 2015). Indeed, getting an adequate amount of sleep is associated with lower anxiety, tension, depression and higher satisfaction with life (Pilcher &amp; Walters, 1997). The topic of student’s mental health has received media attention recently with articles suggesting that there is a “mental health crisis” (Thomas, 2018).</p>
<p><strong>Students and seeking support</strong></p>
<p>Universities provide support for students, and this support maybe come in many forms, from free counselling services to well-being advisors (Raunic &amp; Xenos, 2008).</p>
<p>In one study, it was reported that only 3% of students used their university counselling service, and only 5% of those who were characterised as vulnerable based on questionnaire scores, used the services (Cooke et al., 2006). This suggests that the majority of students did not make use of services available.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why students may not choose to seek help, including being unaware of services, low socio-economic status, being from an Asian background, embarrassment about having to seek help and scepticism about the services (Eisenberg et al., 2007; Gulliver et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Another issue around seeking support is that many who do chose to get help, have to wait long periods for appointments (Mowbray et al., 2006). In a recent article reported in the Independent, a waiting time of 4 months was cited for some universities. These delays to support, can lead to emergence of mental health crises situations. Unfortunately, in this the University of Glasgow had one of the longest wait times for counselling (Buchan, 2018).</p>

<span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Topic 3: Belonging at University<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#topic-3-belonging-at-university"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>There is extensive evidence that feeling a sense of belonging (also sometimes referred to as identifying with a group) is considered to be a basic psychological need (Baumeister &amp; Leary, 1995). Feeling like we belong can foster a sense of personal control (Greenaway et al, 2015), increase meaning and purpose in life (Haslam et al., 2018) protect from existential anxiety (Sani, Herrera &amp; Bowe, 2009), and promote reciprocal support (Levine, Prosser, Evans, &amp; Reicher, 2005).</p>
<p>Furthermore, research has found a robust link between feeling like you belong to a range of different social groups (including family, University, workplace, and friend groups) and positive psychological outcomes. These outcomes include a degree of protection from depression (Cruwys et al., 2014; Sani et al. 2012), anxiety (Sani et al., 2012; Wakefield et al., 2013), post-traumatic stress (Swartzman et al., 2016), paranoia (Sani et al.,, 2017; Greenaway et al., 2018), and cognitive decline (Haslam et al., 2010).</p>
<p>Thinking specifically about University, having a sense of belonging is associated with academic success and motivation (Freeman et al., 2007). There is also evidence that it is related to students’ wellbeing, with higher levels of postive emotions, self-worth and social acceptance being linked with feelings of belonging to University (Pittman and Richmond, 2007; Wilson et al., 2015). Students who do not feel like they connect with their University may be more likely to disengage, increasing the likelihood of considering leaving university without completing (Pedler et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Given these findings, it is important to understand what can help facilitate a sense of belonging at University, and what barriers might be in place to reduce the likelihood of feeling like you belong.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitating a sense of belonging for students</strong></p>
<p>There has been a recent focus on how Universities can develop a sense of belonging for their students, e.g, Samura (2022) published an article in The Conversation discussing how we can meaningfully think about belonging at University. WONKHE (an organisation related to debate in Higher Education) and Pearson (an academic publisher) published a (non-peer-reviewed) report exploring ways in which institutions can help students develop a sense of belonging. They found that there were four key areas that were important: connection (e.g. developing friendships and peer connections), inclusion (e.g. diverse, inclusive content), support (e.g. ability to access appropriate support at the point of needing it) and autonomy (e.g. being able to contribute to the wider university experience) (Blake et al., 2022).</p>
<p>Pedler et al. (2022) found that there are positive correlations between belonging, motivation and enjoyment at University. It also seems to be the case that a sense of belonging is related to specific actions/behaviours that support achievement in students (Gillen-O'Neel, 2021). Many of the studies in this area have looked at these through a quantitative lens, with fewer delving into why these relationships might occur, or why they might be important to students.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">2.3.4</span> Rationale for using qualitative methodologies<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rationale-for-using-qualitative-methodologies"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In research methodology “fitting the approach to the research purposes is the critical issue” (Rossi, Lipsey, &amp; Freeman, 2003), therefore all decisions about methodology have to be made after careful consideration about their fitness for purpose. Since qualitative approaches to research design are suited to uncovering new ideas and exploring areas that have not been investigated before (Marshall &amp; Rossman, 2014) your projects will use qualitative methods.</p>
<p>The main purpose of a focus group is to draw upon the range of respondents’ attitudes and feelings; this could not be done using other methods such as interviews or observations. Compared to individual interviews, which aim to obtain individual attitudes and feelings, focus groups can be used to obtain a group consensus. More data can be collected in a shorter period of time.</p>
<p>When using qualitative approaches their emphasis is on describing a meaningful social world (Silverman, 2015). Quantitative and qualitative approaches produce different, but not incompatible data. Therefore, using qualitative methods does not detract from what already exists within the quantitative literature.</p>
<p>Indeed, both qualitative and quantitative approaches can produce different data, which together explores the phenomenon. Let's think about it using a different example to those in the topics above. For example, past research in the area of poor quality sleep suggests that whie sleep quality is accepted as a clinical construct, it represents a complex phenomenon that is difficult to measure and define. It could be argued that “sleep quality” can be measured could contain quantitative aspects- for example duration of time sleeping or number of arousals. However, there are also more subjective aspects to sleep too, such as restfulness.</p>

</h3>
<p>Some of the topics may be sensitive for people, and therefore it is important to not be overly direct and also to be ethical in the way you ask questions. If you are asking about mental health, for example, don't ask your participants about their own mental health. Remember that you will be working with your peers, and they will be known to you. Instead, ask about their opinions to do with mental health.</p>
<p>When designing questions, you can refer to chapter 3 as cited in Braun and Clarke (Braun &amp; Clarke, 2013), as well as guidance cited in Agee (2009). In terms of next steps, you need to agree on a topic area, and potential research questions.
