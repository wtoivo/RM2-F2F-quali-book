</h3>
<p>We suggest scheduling your focus group for Week 8.</p>
<p>Two people should run the focus group - one person should act as the facilitator and the other person should act as the note-taker. This is the minimum required to run the focus group.</p>
<p>If other members of your group would like to come along to watch, this is okay (but please ask your participants if they are comfortable with this). If additional members do join to observe, they should not participate in the group, and should have their microphones and camera's turned off so as not to interfere with the process.</p>
<p>We anticipate focus groups will be around 30-45 minutes (not including ice-breaker and setting things up at the start) - yours may be shorter or longer than this, but please discuss with your participants if you are planning a longer focus group, and ask them if they'd be comfortable with extending it.</p>
<p>Ethics information and the finalised version of the focus group schedule (just the main questions, not the probes/prompts) must be sent to your focus group members in advance, and they must return signed consent forms to you. Keep these safe - they do not need to be passed on to the Course Leads.</p>
<p>Please use the checklist and allocation activities that were given to you to complete in the <a href="https://wtoivo.github.io/RM2-F2F-quali-book/labs.html#week-5-lab-5-running-a-focus-group">Week 5 lab</a>.</p>

These do not need to be submitted for formative assessment. There are only a few, minor, sections in each form that need adapted in order to make them specific for your project.</p>
<p>You must give everyone participating in the group the Information sheet and consent form before the focus group takes place. Completed consent forms should be returned to the group hosting the focus group before the group commences. These must be destroyed after hand-in of the project.</p>
<p>Plan what the best approach for this will be among your group, and agree who will be responsible for this.</p>
<p>Remember that everyone (both those participating and running) the focus group have a responsibility to maintain confidentiality of the discussion.</p>

</h3>
<p>It might be a good idea to collect demographics information - discuss with your group what might be best to collect. Remember to only collect what you need to help the reader understand the context of your focus group. Demographics information must be collected using Microsoft Forms.</p>
<p>Sign into Microsoft forms and click new quiz</p>

Figure 3.1: How to make a new quiz
</p>
</div>
<p>Then click add new question and you will be able to select the type of question. There are a number of options; it's most likely that choice (multiple choice) or text (open textbox) will be what you will use.</p>

Figure 3.2: Adding questions
</p>
</div>
<p>Your first question should ask for the identifier. When you give the participants the consent form, there should be a number that you assign to them. This helps you link up the person and the demographics but without asking them to provide their name.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.1.4</span> Focus group structure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#focus-group-structure"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>There are a number of stages to a focus group, and it's not always exactly the same, but we would advise the following structure for your focus group:</p>
<p><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Setting the scene. The topic of the project should be introduced by the facilitator, and everyone agrees to take part. It must be made clear to the people in your focus group a) that they do not have to answer any questions that they do not feel comfortable with, b) highlight that the session will be recorded, and they have a choice to have their camera on or off, but that the mic must be used, c) what will happen with the recordings (i.e. that they will be kept safe on University-approved servers and the transcript anonymised), d) that everyone has a responsibility to maintain confidentiality of the topics discussed in the group and e) that they are free to leave the session at any time. Run through the Information Sheet and Consent Form here, and discuss any ground rules you have. I would also raise the point here that there are a few questions to get through, and therefore you might have to step in to help manage time.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2:</strong> Recording. Remember to press record!! This is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 3:</strong> Introductions. Go around the 'table' and ask everyone to introduce themselves. Start with yourself and the note-taker first. Everyone should state their first name clearly.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 4:</strong> Ice-breaker. Ask a warm-up question or ice-breaker. The aim is to allow participants to introduce themselves, ensure everyone understands the procedure, and to encourage people to feel comfortable talking. Previous projects have used photos, cartoons, and media, or asked participants to generate meanings of the terms used in the discussion (e.g., “poor sleep”,”well-being”) to get people talking.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 5:</strong> Discussion. This is where you ask your main questions, and follow-up questions. It is a good idea to prepare around five or six main questions, and perhaps highlight three or four that are most important to focus on. The discussion may follow a different order to that on the focus group schedule - this is fine.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 6:</strong> Facilitating the discussion. The facilitator should be prepared to help steer conversation back on track, and balance discussion so that everyone gets a chance to contribute. Have a few specific prompts that relate to each question and/or some general prompts to keep the discussion flowing. What are you going to do if no-one participates? Or if one person is contributing? For example… “has anyone else had a similar experience? ..Does anyone have a different view?” At the same time be ethical and avoid targeting people. Give participants the opportunity to describe their interpretations and take ownership. E.g., “How would…make you feel”, “Have you ever noticed that…” “Think back to when…”, “What was most important to you about…?”</p>
<p><strong>Stage 7:</strong> Ending the discussion. It's good to end the discussion by going round the group and asking each participant if they have anything they want to add to the discussion/sum up their thoughts on what was discussed.Remember to allow focus group members the chance to confirm/withdraw consent for their anonymised contributions to be used. Also remind them that the discussion cannot be reproduced/recorded for any other purpose than for the qualitative report.</p>
<p>Please discuss some 'ground rules' at the start with the group, and also go through the Information Sheet and consent form at the start, to ensure everyone is aware of their responsibilities.</p>

</h4>
<p>The facilitator (sometimes also known as the moderator) will be the person taking the lead during the focus group. They will be the one asking the questions of the participants, and the one facilitating the discussion. As you are aiming to mimic a naturalistic conversation, you have to build rapport. Ensure you allow everyone time to introduce themselves, and contribute to the ice-breaking phase by saying a bit about yourself.</p>
<p>A good interviewer shares the perspective of the people they are talking to throughout the focus group. The interviewer should not be listening out for good quotes and should not be thinking about what to analyse. The role of the interviewer is to listen to the participants, and understand their points of view.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.1.5.2</span> Note-taking<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#note-taking"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>It is a good idea to have a note-taker there. Hopefully there will be no IT issues that mean that the recording doesn't work! Therefore, the note-taker should remind the facilitator about recording if required, and note down any impressions/initial thoughts around themes/good quotes. This can be helpful when you come to analysis. Was anything unexpected? Did participants focus on a particular aspect of a question over others? Was there anything that the discussion kept coming back to? Also, you could note down how well the questions worked - were there any that participants didn't understand?</p>

</h4>
<p>There is likely to be variety in the class in terms of how to manage group dynamics in your focus group. Here, we have some tips for those who might find them useful.</p>
<p><strong>Balance contributions from those who are quieter and those who are more dominant in a group situation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The ice-breaker/easy opening questions are perhaps most important for quieter members of the group, to help make them feel more comfortable.</li>
<li>It might be a good idea to use the 'Raise hand' feature on Teams - this would allow quieter members to show that they want to contribute, but without trying to gauge when to jump in the conversation. You can then take points in order of when they raised their hands.</li>
<li>If some people have contributed to part of the discussion and others haven't, open it up to the rest by asking if anyone who hasn't responded yet has anything to add. However, don't put people on the spot by asking them directly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If the discussion is stuck on one topic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Remind the members of the group that there are a number of different questions to explore, and that you are mindful of time, so it might be best to leave that topic for now, and you can return if there's time at the end.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are unsure what someone meant</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Seek clarity during the focus group if you are unsure about what a participant meant during the discussion.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p>You don’t have much control of the environment, as we are all doing our focus groups online using Microsoft Teams. It is not possible to do them in person due to logistical restraints (recording equipment and booking space) and you cannot use platforms other than Microsoft Teams due to logistics (Zoom is limited to 40 mins) as well as University requirements around GDPR.</p>
<p>You will be recording the visual and audio content of this focus group. Practice using the Teams environment with the rest of your group in advance. See <a href="https://echo360.org.uk/media/ac9666b4-d793-4843-b3fe-070098e57110/public">this video</a> for help.</p>
<p>Please press record before you start the focus group! You do not want to end the focus group and find out that you didn’t press the right button and the whole thing is gone. Just in case, a member of the group could be taking notes. This should never be the interviewer, as this would distract them from their task of understanding what is being said.</p>
<p>After the focus group, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you think your research question has been answered? If not, why not?</li>
<li>If participants went off-track, is that because there was a flaw in your questions, or because they hit on a topic that was more interesting to them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Either way, you can write up a really strong project by being reflexive and considering what you could do differently in future.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pilot the focus group schedule on friends first</li>

<li>Do a test recording beforehand using Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Stream (transcription software). This should be done early enough that you can contact one of the Course Leads if there are any issues.</li>
<li>See the 15 minute video here for how to set up and record a Teams meeting and access the transcript.</li>

<p><strong>GDPR: general data protection regulation.</strong> It is the most up to date data protection law.</p>
<p>For your project it is important that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data will be retained until after completion of the project on a password-protected encrypted drive and a secure database accessible only to the research team.</li>
<li>After this period (end of academic year 2020-21), any paper documents will be shredded and disposed and electronic files will be deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Storing and Accessing Data Securely</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make a copy of the recording from Stream onto a secure file sharing network (i.e. One Drive via Office 365).</li>
<li>Delete the recording from Stream as soon as you have done this (double-/triple-check you have saved the recording properly beforehand!).</li>
<li>Make sure that you only share the anonymised transcript with the group via One Drive.</li>

<p>For your RM2 project, you will be recording your groups online. This means that it should be possible to use the auto-generated transcript. The auto-generated transcript normally take a little while longer to generate than the recording - it is normal for it to take up to 24h to arrive. If you use the auto-generated transcript, then it should be relatively easy to obtain a transcript for the whole focus group.</p>
<p>If the auto-generated transcript does not work for any reason, then it is fine to just transcribe a 10 minute portion of the focus group from the recording by hand. Ideally, this should be a whole 10 mins (e.g. not 2 mins at the start, 5 in the middle and 3 at the end).</p>
<p>Please see the steps outlined in 'Setting up and recording the online focus group' (part of <a href="https://wtoivo.github.io/RM2-F2F-quali-book/qualitative-project-data-collection-and-processing-group.html#practical-considerations">'Practical considerations'</a> for information about how to download your transcript from Stream.</p>
<p>This section will instead contain details of how you should move the content over from the autogenerated text file to the transcript, and what we'd typically expect to see.</p>

<p><a href="https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/ETGUHXlV0LJKoJQnFID6WUYBUjRn3BTal_kNoXW6F5296A?e=vR9hvS">Here is an example of a template</a> that you might find useful. You are not required to use this, but you are welcome to do so.You will have to download your own copy as you will not be able to edit the original.</p>
<p>At the top, complete the details of all those who attended the focus group. We'll anonymise later, as it's easier to do this all at once rather than as we go along.</p>
<p>It's advisable to have a time stamp regularly (I normally do one per minute), so that I can easily find the right part in the original recording if I have to. However, if you do not want to put this in, you do not need to. There are line numbers in the template - it is good practice to include these, but it can be time-consuming to do so. If you would prefer to remove the line number column, this is okay.</p>
<p>With each new speaker, take a new line in the table. You will need to add more lines to the table - do this by inserting rows at the bottom. Only move to a new cell with each new speaker.</p>
<p>The next step is to go through the transcript and compare it to the recording. Are there any parts that the auto-gen transcript that are incorrect? Replace these in the transcript with what should be the case.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.1.8</span> Processing data: Anonymisation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#processing-data-anonymisation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Decide in your groups what needs to be anonymised. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaker names?</li>
<li>Names mentioned within the transcript?</li>
<li>Locations?</li>
<li>Job titles?</li>
<li>Unusual situations (e.g. I had a participant who had an experience that they spoke about and had been in the newspapers...we had to change the details of this to ensure it was anonymous).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Are you going to remove the information completely or replace it?</p>
<p>If we had a transcript with the following information:</p>
<p>"So, yeah, John and I went to uni together in Leeds, and we met up with Sandy for the first time there. All three of us went a trip to Broughty Ferry."</p>
<p><em>Option 1: We have the option of replacing:</em></p>
<p>"So, yeah, Mike and I went to uni together in Manchester, and we met up with Karen for the first time there. All three of us went a trip to Montrose."</p>
<p>If you replace, keep it consistent throughout the transcript (e.g. every time John is mentioned, it should be replaced with Mike; each time Leeds is mentioned, it should be replaced with Manchester).</p>
<p>The easiest thing to do is have a key (this is just a document where you have noted what all the replacements are) - in this, just state what you are using for each unique replacement. Once you've replaced everything that needs replaced, you can delete the key.</p>
<p>You should have a clear rationale for what you are replacing, and should be upfront with the reader in your methods section if you choose this.</p>
<p><em>Option 2: We have the option of redacting:</em></p>
<p>"So, yeah, (brother) and I went to uni together in (city in England), and we met up with (friend) for the first time there. All three of us went a trip to (small town in Scotland)."</p>
<p>You should always replace the speaker names (i.e. denoting who is speaking in the transcript), but you can redact the actual words spoken if you choose.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Discuss in your group, and arrange which approach you want to take. Decide who is going to anonymise the transcript.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> How to structure your focus group schedule<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#how-to-structure-your-focus-group-schedule"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Preparation is essential for the focus group process to run smoothly. This includes taking the time to think about and try out your focus group schedule.</p>
<p>At this stage we are looking for an example of an icebreaker, and the main questions you want to ask your participants (with prompts/probes, if appropriate). You should also have an exit/wrap up question.
- Prompts are additional questions to remind your participants of the key points – you would only need to use these if they don’t answer part of the question in their answer.
- Probes are supplementary questions that you can ask to get more information: e.g. to clarify or justify something, or to give an example.</p>
<p>You should choose around five to six main questions for your focus group from the question bank. If you need to alter these slightly so that they make sense, this is fine. However, if you modify them significantly or you make up new questions, you must go to your tutor’s office hours to discuss your questions with them before you use them in your focus group.</p>
<div id="warm-up-question" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Warm up Question<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#warm-up-question"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Start off with a warm up question. The aim is to allow participants to introduce themselves, ensure everyone understands the procedure, and to encourage people to feel comfortable talking. Previous projects have used photos, cartoons, and media, or asked participants to generate meanings of the terms used in the discussion (e.g., “poor sleep”,”well-being”) to get people talking. In other focus groups, students have asked people to describe the place they would most like to visit or what their favourite meal from their home country is. It should be a question that generates discussion and is something that is easy to answer.</p>
</div>
<div id="main-focus-group-questions" class="section level3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Main Focus Group Questions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#main-focus-group-questions"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Choose 5-6 questions on your topic from the list in <a href="https://wtoivo.github.io/RM2-F2F-quali-book/qualitative-project-data-collection-and-processing-group.html#question-bank">the question bank</a>. You may need to modify these slightly to get them to work for your topic. Remember that, if you need to make a new question up, you can do so. However, you will need to run it past your tutor to make sure it is appropriate.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that you may not cover all aspects of your research question in one focus group - the discussion may wander off track or focus on one aspect. Consider which part of the research question you think is most important to get people to answer. Start with this and be prepared to come back to it at the end if you need to. If you have more sensitive questions in your research schedule, they should be included later on, so people answer them when they are more comfortable.</p>
<p>Some tips for developing questions:
- Avoid asking questions that ask two or three things in one sentence (e.g., about behaviour and impact on mood). Break it down into simpler questions.
- Try to avoid asking questions that can be answered yes/no, unless you then follow up with a question opening things up. Although yes/no questions are useful for gathering information, they are not helpful for generating a discussion. Your questions should be open.
- Add in probes/prompts to elicit further information if required.
- Remember to ask people about their perspectives/perceptions/experiences/opinions/views</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.3.3</span> Closing question<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#closing-question"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The aim here is to give people an opportunity to add anything that might have been missed in the discussion/to wrap things up. Examples might be ‘Does anyone have anything else that they would like to add before we finish the focus group?’ or ‘Thank you for your participation – is there anything that anyone would like to add before we wrap things up?’</p>
