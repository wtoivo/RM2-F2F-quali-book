Wilson argued strong evolutionary basis effect: species spent hundreds thousands years (nearly evolutionary history) living thriving within natural environments, humans deep rooted connection nature beneficial us. Since everyday survival depended activities finding food, water firewood, avoiding predators, required humans attentive responsive cues environment might offer, individuals connected nature important advantage context.half world’s population lives urban, rather rural, environment expected increase 68% 2050 (United Nations, 2018; World Health Organization, 2011). Canada, 80% people live urban areas, Canadians spend almost 90% time indoors (Howell & Passmore, 2013). survey 1,000 United Kingdom citizens, 55% age 35, 37% age 35, reported feeling “connected natural world” (Royal Society Protection Birds, 2010). time-criterion nature- knowledge-criterion studies show nature-based recreation decline many countries (Charles & Louv, 2009).time, research nature connectedness shows engaging natural environments can beneficial effects wide range psychological physiological aspects wellbeing (Burns, 2005; White et al., 2019), effects can seen even relatively minor interventions (Berto, 2005). last 30 years, environmental positive psychologists gathered considerable evidence supports idea humans benefit contact nature ( Berto, 2014; Howell & Passmore, 2013), green space can provide buffer negative health impact stressful life events (van den Berg et al., 2010). available research investigates wide range benefits, physical health longevity happiness, cognitive focus attentional capacity, done using wide variety methods. Considering preponderance stress mental health problems facing developed world (Gullone, 2000; , 2022), studying effects nature important task psychologists. personally relevant note, understanding effects green spaces animals wellbeing can give another set tools can used enhance wellbeing help cope stress university life.Nature affiliation access natureThere two important related concepts nature connectedness literature.access nature means extent person contact nature, can measured objectively logging location looking area maps. lot epidemiological studies use objective measures green space access see affects population health, experimental studies can use nature contact interventions see people respond.Nature connectedness/affiliation trait: means personal characteristics make person appreciate nature usually measured self-report questionnaires. defined “individuals’ experiential sense oneness natural world” (Mayer & Frantz, 2004). Smaller studies often look trait nature connectedness interacts nature access predict various aspects wellbeing.State nature connectedness: means current, changing relationship nature, something “dynamic, changing day day moment moment function experiences nature” (Weinstein, Przybylski, & Ryan, 2009).Research effects nature access connectednessLarge scale epidemiological researchOne possible ways investigating nature connectedness comparing similar populations varying degrees access natural environments. One studies analysed five year survival rates 3000 Tokyo seniors, born 1903 1918 (Takano, Nakamura, & Watanabe, 2002) found longevity greater among senior citizens living areas walkable green spaces. Variables age, sex, marital status, socioeconomic status, baseline physical ability controlled. walkable green streets spaces near seniors’ residences showed significant predictive value elderly survival 5 years study.Holland, researchers reviewed records 250,782 citizens treated 104 general practitioners confirmed robust relationship green spaces health (Maas, Verheij, Groenewegen, de Vries, & Spreeuwenberg, 2006). paper reported “health differences residents urban rural municipalities large extent explained amount green space” individuals’ direct living environment (p. 591). Additionally, relation green space health found stronger lower socioeconomic groups elderly, youth, secondary educated people large cities seemed benefit presence green areas living environment groups.Finally, University Glasgow researchers (Mitchell & Popham, 2008) looked income-related health inequality within English population retirement age, obtaining anonymised data Office National Statistics amassing data 40 million people. found populations living greenest environments also lowest levels health inequality related income deprivation lower -cause circulatory mortality rates.Overall, available large scale epidemiological research shows clear association access green spaces urban areas living natural setting various subjective objective health outcomes. associations remain relevant controlling education income, fact become stronger lower levels socioeconomic status. implications supporting student mental health higher education (Hughes & Spanner, 2019), universities recognising impact campus environment green space part stepped approach supporting student mental health wellbeing (Universities UK, 2020).Correlational researchThere numerous correlational studies look nature access nature affiliation affect different aspects wellbeing. studies established three measures nature affiliation found significant correlations scales life satisfaction (Mayer & Frantz, 2004), positive affect (Mayer et al., 2009) autonomy, positive affect personal growth (Nisbet, Zelenski, & Murphy, 2011). Herzog & Strevey (2008) also showed undergraduate students’ self-reported degree contact nature correlated positive affect personal growth.Experimental researchExperimental research nature access connectedness focused presenting participants nature-related interventions observing whether positive effect variety measures health wellbeing. Mayer et al. (2009) carried three experiments manipulating exposure nature - spending 15 min either nature park urban setting, watching 10-min video clip nature urban setting engaging nature walk watch video clip walk. three studies, nature condition effect negative affect, participants’ positive affect boosted compared control conditions. Berman, Jonides, & Kaplan (2008) randomly assigned undergraduate students spend 50 min walking either park urban setting, discovered nature walk resulted mood increase. Weinstein et al. (2009) carried 4 experiments looking whether exposure nature affected value intrinsic aspirations, goals satisfy basic psychological needs (personal growth, intimacy, community) extrinsic aspirations, pursued derive rewards positive regard others (e.g., money, image, fame). four studies, participants exposed nature endorsed intrinsic less extrinsic values, turn related helpfulness social situations, feelings community cohesion.Qualitative approachDespite richness quantitative studies topic, qualitative enquiries published date.
