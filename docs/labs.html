<p>In Lab 2, you will form into the groups that you will be in for the rest of the semester. You will be able to find your group in the spreadsheet at the bottom of the <a href="https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=38155&amp;section=3">Week 2 Moodle</a> (please note the spreadsheet will only become available once it has been released at the start of Week 2). In these groups, you will a) design, run and transcribe a focus group with a group in your lab as your participants, b) participate in another group's focus group, and c) write a qualitative group proposal.</p>
<p>In today's lab, there will be some time spent getting to know each other, then we will ask you to develop a group agreement (see below). You should also discuss the <a href="https://wtoivo.github.io/RM2-F2F-quali-book/qualitative-project-preparation-group.html#topic-guide">different topics</a> that you can choose for your project, seeing whether any stand out as preferred options among the group.</p>

</h3>
<p>We appreciate that group work can be challenging and we want to support you to have an enjoyable and educational group work experience. To that end, we would like each group to create a group agreement that all members sign. The purpose of this is for the group to come together and establish common ground and rules that each of the group members is committed to.</p>
<p>After you have all introduced yourselves, download the <a href="https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EX0j7-IboldEnapucgQ7h-YBgvV1_YeuUcNhWi9z_996oQ?e=BkLLbx">group agreement template</a>. Then look at the list of potential items to include. These are provided within the template document itself, as well as in <strong>Chapter 2.2.1.</strong> As a group, discuss which items you want to include in addition to the standard ones provided, and if there are any you would like to edit or add outside of this list.</p>
<p>After this, you should allocate tasks for the <strong>group proposal</strong> among the members of the group. A starter list of tasks is provided in the template as well as in <strong>Chapter 2.2.2</strong>. The task allocation must be uploaded in the same document as the signed group agreement.</p>
<p>Work on a collaborative document on OneDrive to create your group work agreement and allocation of tasks for the group proposal. Once the group is happy with their agreement, <em>each group member</em> should sign it and submit it to Moodle individually (Formative Assessment Section). You can either all sign the same document and upload a copy each, or you can sign separately and upload the copy that only you have signed. Each person should submit their signed group agreement and task allocation before their lab in Week 3.</p>
<p>Once the deadline has passed, we will be in touch with any groups where any members have not uploaded a group agreement and task allocation for the group proposal.</p>

<p>In your groups, have a look at the Topic Guide. There are three topics to choose from: Green Spaces, Belonging and Mental Health.</p>
<p>Have a look over the topics - are there any that your group are particularly drawn towards at this stage? You might know immediately what you'd like to focus on, or might need to discuss all of them in your group.</p>
<p>Once you've chosen a topic (you might not manage this in the lab, which is fine!), have a think about possible research questions. You will need to have a finalised RQ for your group proposal, which is submitted in Week 5.</p>

</h3>
<p><strong>Research Question (this is also relevant for our FG questions)</strong></p>
<p><em>This might look like:</em> In qualitative research, we often ask about someone’s lived
experience, or their motivations, or a belief they have. This is quite different to
quantitative research.</p>
<p><em>Why might this be an issue:</em> Qualitative research tends to be on topics where we ask
people to be vulnerable and open themselves up to us as researchers. If we don't frame
this correctly, our interview schedule might contain questions that are inappropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Data Collection</strong></p>
<p><em>This might look like:</em> Data collection is much less likely to be anonymous, as typically in-
person or online focus groups or interviews are held. Samples are small, and
participants may already be known to the researcher.</p>
<p><em>Why might this be an issue:</em> There are possible issues of confidentiality, anonymity
(these will be discussed further down) and bias. Our preconceptions might affect the
way we frame the questions, how we interact with participants in the focus group, and
how we interpret the data.</p>
<p><strong>Recording a focus group or interview</strong></p>
<p><em>This might look like:</em> The majority of the time, focus groups and interviews are recorded
(either audio + video or audio only). This means that the 'raw' data - as it were - is
identifiable. In contrast, data for quant studies are often collected anonymously.</p>
<p><em>Why might this be an issue:</em> Data should always be kept safe and secure. However, with
qualitative data, there is a real risk that individual people could be identified from a
recording of them. This means that dealing with the recordings in a safe and secure
way are of utmost importance, and that participants cannot be identified from
transcripts.</p>
<p><strong>Anonymity</strong></p>
<p><em>This might look like:</em> In quantitative research, we tend to report summary statistics from
groups, and therefore it’d be quite unusual to be able to identify a single participant
from the data. With qualitative, it’s a bit different. We collect people’s words and
experiences.</p>
<p><em>Why might this be an issue:</em> It is easier to identify someone from the words they use,
and the situations and circumstances they describe.</p>
<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>
<p><em>This might look like:</em> In a focus group or interview, people might be very open with us,
and tell us things about their life, and the lives of others.</p>
<p><em>Why might this be an issue:</em> We have a duty of care to keep anything that comes out in a
focus group/interview confidential (unless they disclose a crime or someone is judged
to be at risk). It’s also vital that the rest of the focus group members keep the
information confidential too.</p>

<p>In Lab 4, we will work on developing questions for your focus group. We have made a <a href="https://wtoivo.github.io/RM2-F2F-quali-book/qualitative-project-data-collection-and-processing-group.html#collecting-data-questions">bank of questions</a> available to you. Please select any questions that you would like to use and then adapt them to suit your research question.</p>
<p>If you have developed a research question that means you need different focus group questions to those in the question bank,then you may need to make up some new questions to go into your focus group schedule.</p>
<p>If you develop new questions that have not been adapted from the bank of questions provided, please ensure you do the following:</p>

<p>
Jane:…I grew up in Brighton and you see men holding hands all the
time in Brighton, and Tim came out when I was about 12 or 13 (pause) I
think he was 16 or maybe 15, he was definitely still at Michael Hall
because I used to get teased about being gay myself…
</p>
<p>
Interviewer: And, when did you come out?
</p>
<p>
Jane: I came out in the first year of university so I must have been
19 or 20, I had a gap year before going to Durham…my mum freaked a bit,
she was totally okay, but I think even for her – someone who lives in
Brighton and writes for the Guardian – two gay kids was a bit much… my
Aunty Julie, my mum’s sister, was absolutely wonderful though, and she’s
a lesbian…

</h2>
<p>We often ask for students to demonstrate <em>evaluation</em> in their writing, i.e. going beyond paraphrasing and descriptive writing. Essentially, we are looking for you to develop critical, evidence-based arguments that demonstrate your thinking.</p>
<p>In today's lab, we are going to focus on how you might incorporate evaluation into your introduction and discussion. This will not only support you for the RM2 report, but also any other submissions you have (including your dissertation).</p>

</h3>
<p>The purpose of your introduction is to provide a rationale for your study and answer the WHY question; why is your study worth doing? You want to sell your idea to the reader, using existing literature to show how you are building on the evidence that is there.</p>
<p>In Activity 1, read the following extracts from an introduction section. As a group, identify <em>two</em> aspects of evaluation that could be improved for this study.</p>
<div class="info">
<p>
<strong>Extract 1</strong> A study by Lane and Karin (2011) looked at
zombie apocalypse survival confidence levels in undergraduate students.
The sample consisted of 25 participants (20 male and 5 female),
recruited through convenience sampling. The study employed involved a
survey comprising Likert-scale questions designed to measure
participants’ self-assessed confidence in various survival skills.
Additionally, participants were asked about their exposure to
zombie-related media. The data were subjected to t-tests and regression
analyses, and the authors’ found that the biggest predictor of zombie
apocalypse confidence was exposure to zombie-themed video games.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Extract 2</strong> It should be noted that the majority of
studies on zombie apocalypse survival confidence have looked at samples
that consist of mostly men (Lane &amp; Karin, 2011 but see also Grimes
&amp; Dixon, 2019), and that previous samples have been small.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Extract 3</strong> To date, there has been only one
qualitative study on the topic – Seok (2013) collected data through
semi-structured interviews, which were analysed using thematic analysis
and two themes, “Survival mode” and “Confidence through skills” were
identified. This study looked at undergraduate students; there is no
previous literature on postgraduate students’ perceptions of their
apocalyptic confidence. Therefore, this qualitative study investigates
the perceived confidence of postgraduate students in their abilities to
survive a zombie apocalypse.

</h3>
<p>The purpose of your discussion is to summarise your results, contextualising them and situating them within the broader research context. As part of this process, it is important to consider the implications of your work, as well as the limitations and possible future directions. Discussions should be rooted in the evidence base, rather than based on personal opinion.</p>
<p>In Activity 2, read the following extracts from a discussion section. As a group, identify <em>two</em> aspects of evaluation that could be improved for this study.</p>
<div class="info">
<p>
<strong>Extract 1</strong> In this study, our investigation into the
realm of confidence in preparing for the zombie apocalypse has revealed
nuanced insights into individuals’ perceptions of their readiness for
this so-far-unrealised scenario. Theme 1 was perceived media influence
of feelings of preparedness. Here, we found that participants were more
likely to feel prepared for the apocalypse when they watched zombie TV
shows, which is in line with Lincoln and Reedus (2014). In Theme 2, we
found that confidence was improved through perceived cooperation. This
does not align with the most recent evidence, namely Morgan et
al. (2023). These findings contribute to our understanding of how
individuals navigate the complex interplay between personal beliefs,
social interactions, and cultural representations when assessing their
preparedness for extreme and unlikely events.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Extract 2</strong> There were a number of limitations in this
study. Firstly, it is important to note that we were unable to
generalise as there were only four participants in the study. Secondly,
we are currently unable to tell whether confidence in zombie apocalypse
survival translates to real-world skills. Finally, a limitation is that
the questions did not consider how postgraduates might reduce their
vulnerability to zombie attacks.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Extract 3</strong> This study offers insights into broader
psychological phenomena and practical interventions. Governments around
the world should take these findings and incorporate them into their
disaster relief programs. This will enable policymakers and educators to
further enhance individuals’ capacity to critically evaluate their
preparedness, bridging the gap between perceived and actual abilities.
Moreover, this research illuminates the ways in which fictional contexts
can impact real-world perceptions, shedding light on cognitive biases
and media’s potential to shape individuals’ self-assessment (Masterson,
2020). As the world faces increasingly diverse and unpredictable
challenges, understanding how individuals approach threats from the
zombie apocalypse helps foster a holistic approach to readiness in an
ever-changing landscape.

Extract from E_NM4 Interview <a href="https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/855322/">LGBT staff networks
on UK Data Service</a>
</p>
<p>
RESEARCHER: So, how do you, how do you influence the organisation or
how do you try to influence the organisation?
</p>
<p>
CHARLES: Erm, the best person to go to in this organisation is,
Lillian.
</p>
<p>
RESEARCHER: Why’s that?
</p>
<p>
CHARLES: Because, erm, she’ll give you a cut and dry answer, a yes or
a no, erm, which is great, ’cause that’s what you want, you don’t want -
I don’t want to go to someone that, if I go to Leo with it, generally
it’s, what’s it gonna cost me? So, we have a budget of the group, but if
it’s above the budget, then it’s, what’s it gonna cost, and then it’s
always, there’s to-ing and fro-ing. Erm, if you go to the levels of
management within the Trust, it always gets passed to other people, erm,
one example of this is when we got the rainbow lanyard, erm, I, I said
to Leo I wanted to get some, erm, we’d got them for getting in the
Stonewall Top [ranking] the first year, so Leo agreed that he’d get
them. He bought them and then, they came into the organisation and then,
er, he said, oh, I’ve been speaking - he’d spoken to someone and they
said, oh, you’re gonna have to get approval for them to go out and be
used, so I think we were gonna put them out for LGBT History Month
initially, but then they just sort of stayed. Leo had gone to HR and HR
had said, oh, it’s the uniform policy, we don’t own that, you’ll have to
go to ops, operations, so Leo went to operations and they said, oh, we
don’t own that policy, it’ll be HR, you’ll have to go to them, so he
went back to HR and HR said, well, we’re not comfortable saying it
’cause it’ll have an impact on ops and it’ll have an impact on this, so
you’ll have to go to - and it just went round and round and round and
for like, ten days, Leo was like, I don’t know where to go with it, I
really don’t know what we do, no-one will take ownership. So, I, I
picked one of the lanyards up, walked into Lillian’s office and said, do
you like this, and she said, oh yeah, it’s great, can I have one, and I
was like, yep, there we go. I was like, the problem is, we don’t know
who owns the policy, who can we - and immediately she went, no, this is,
this is what it’s for, this is what it is, put them out, and I think,
you know, sometimes you just need someone who’s gonna make them
decisions and be like, yes actually, we’ll support it.
</p>
<p>
RESEARCHER: Yeah, yeah, no, I can see that, it’s kind of a straight
answer and, you know, not being sent, you know, around into a circle.
So, do you think, you know, when you’re thinking about what the network
is doing now, do you think the network should be doing something
else?
</p>
<p>
CHARLES: Erm, I don’t think we have the capacity to do any more. I
think, erm, it’d be great if we had enough people that, someone sat on
all of the meetings and all of the groups within the Trust, it had a, a
staff network member, erm, I’ve found that as the chair of the group, I
get invited to a lot of these groups now, erm, and I do try and attend
as many as I can, so I’m now on a health and wellbeing group and I’m on,
erm, there’s another one I’m on, erm, but there’s other that like, the
vehicle working group. I’d like to have someone sat on there so
actually, we could influence it, actually could we have an LGBT sticker
or can we have - do you know what I mean? Just, and it might be that
they have no input for long periods, but there’s certain points where
there might be that point where they can go, actually, that isn’t
suitable for LGBT staff. Erm, the - but I’d need more people to step up,
I’d need more support, erm, I know with, Camila, that’s just joined the
group, erm, she’s really keen and she’s really showing promise now,
which is great and sort of, can start seeing if she’ll attend some of
these meetings. But I’m aware that her manager at the minute is really
busy, and she’s getting lots of work and I’m not sure what the release
is gonna be like for her to go and do this stuff, ’cause that’s the
other issue.

<p>
<strong>Extract 1 - from a study about the impact of the COVID
pandemic</strong>
</p>
<p>
Sarah spoke of using her leisure time to plan and fantasise about her
wedding:
</p>
<p>
<em>“it’s enough of a fantasy… it’s meant to be stressful, but it’s
really just been fun. It’s like such a nice break from this humdrum life
we’re living in right now” (Sarah: lines 459-461).</em>
</p>
<p>
Organising a significant life event seems to be viewed as granting
Sarah an escape from her current monotony. While she refers to it as a
“fantasy”, potentially given uncertainty of the pandemic’s progression,
she appears to perceive this as constructive and realistic for her
future self. Alternately, Mandy’s leisure activity involved impossible
daydreams:
</p>
<p>
<em>“I started daydreaming more ridiculous stuff… I know it’s never
going to come true ’cause it’s not real, but it still entertains me”
(Mandy: lines 443-444)</em>
</p>
<p>
While Mandy seems to be under no illusion that her daydreams are
feasible, daydreaming impossible scenarios appears to provide more of a
release than realistic situations that are subject to ever changing
government regulations (e.g. travel bans) that may fall through.
</p>
</div>
<div class="info">
<p>
<strong>Extract 2 - from a study about social media use during the
pandemic</strong>
</p>
<p>
Some participants said it was difficult to fall asleep at night,
including those who knew they should fall asleep but could not (<em>“if
I can’t stay up and can’t sleep”- Sarah</em>), or participants
subjectively thought that they did not need sleep or did not want to
fall asleep (<em>“I am not really able to sleep at night, or like, sleep
isn’t really needed.”</em> -Andrew)
</p>
<p>
Participants said that they used social media but that it was only
positive at certain points:
</p>
<p>
<em>I feel like TikTok was fun in the first lockdown during the
summer,’cause of all this summer content I guess, but after that it
really went downhill. I don’t know like, OK personally I deleted all my
apps about three weeks ago</em> (John)
</p>
<p>
John tells us here that he deleted all his apps, because they all
went ‘downhill’. Tik Tok was helpful during the first lockdown, but not
after it.

<ul>
<li>Are you an insider or outsider researcher (i.e. do you belong to the group you are researching or not?</li>
<li>What implications might this have for how you ran your study and how you analysed it?</li>
<li>What preconceptions or expectations did you have about the topic before you ran your focus group?</li>
<li>Did what your participants say agree or disagree? What effect did this have on the way you approached a) data collection or b) data analysis?</li>
